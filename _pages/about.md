Neural dynamics, behavior, and computation
======


I'm a neuroscientist currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone](https://www.int.univ-amu.fr/) in Marseille, France. My research focuses on characterizing the structure and dynamics of brain signals recorded at a single-neuron resolution while animals perform and learn complex tasks. Engineer by training with a PhD in computational neuroscience, my background lies at the intersection of physics, engineering and neurobiology. **My primary research goal is to use quantitative systems-level approaches to understand how dynamic patterns of neural activity give rise to behaviorally-relevant computations in the brain**. In my work, I use a variety of techniques, ranging from electrophysiology, psychophysics, behavioral modeling, probabilistic bayesian inference, as well as dimensionality reduction and statistical methods for neural data processing and analyses.

I obtained my PhD from MIT in 2021 working with [Mehrdad Jazayeri](https://jazlab.org/) in the [Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences & Technology](https://hst.mit.edu/about). Prior to my PhD, I studied aerospace engineering and obtained two MSc from [ISAE-Supa√©ro](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) (2016) and [Caltech](https://galcit.caltech.edu/) (2015).
