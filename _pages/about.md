Neural dynamics, behavior and computation
======

I'm a neuroscientist currently working as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone](https://www.int.univ-amu.fr/) in Marseille, France. My research focuses on characterizing the structure and dynamics of brain signals recorded at a single-neuron resolution while animals perform and learn complex tasks. Engineer by training with a PhD in computational neuroscience, my background lies at the intersection of physics, engineering and neurobiology. My primary research goal is to use quantitative systems-level approaches to understand how dynamic patterns of neural activity in the brain give rise to behaviorally-relevant computations. In my work, I use a variety of techniques and tools, ranging from electrophysiology, psychophysics, behavioral modeling, probabilistic bayesian inference, as well as dimensionality reduction and statistical methods for neural data processing and analyses.

I obtained my PhD from MIT working with [Mehrdad Jazayeri](https://jazlab.org/) in the [Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences & Technology](https://hst.mit.edu/about). Prior to my Phd, I studied aerospace engineering and earned two Msc from [ISAE-Supa√©ro](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) and [Caltech](https://galcit.caltech.edu/).
